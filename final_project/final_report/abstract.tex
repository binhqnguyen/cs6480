\section*{Abstract}
As delay-sensitive traffic such as online real time gaming 
requires a stringent delay budget, moving services close 
to users is beneficial. The current cellular architecture, 
however, hinders the efforts of reducing end-to-end delay 
due to issues such as hierarchical routing and the speed 
of light constraint. We propose an offloading architecture for cellular network 
using Software-defined network (SDN) to snoop and transparently reroute traffic to
servers located inside the cellular core. The approach shows 
significant network performance improvement by 
eliminating both hierarchical routing and Internet delay issues 
while leaving the current architecture untouched.
