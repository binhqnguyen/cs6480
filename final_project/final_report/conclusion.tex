\section{Conclusion}
We leveraged SDN to introduce an offloading architecture for 
cellular networks. The architecture allows traffic to be intercepted 
and rerouted to offloading servers located inside the cellular core. 
This approach not only eliminates the hierarchical routing issue, but also 
removes the Internet delay and showes a promising low end-to-end delay. 
The SDN approach allows us to realize the offloading with minimum modifications on 
the current network architecture.
