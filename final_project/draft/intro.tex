\section{Introduction}

As the mobile network and mobile devices (e.g., smart phone, tablets ) are developed more and more, most of mobile users enjoy the video streaming service( need citation ) and online games on mobile network.  These services usually require low delay for users to enjoy them and generate enormous amount of traffic.

However, the current mobile network architecture inherently has several drawbacks for supporting these services effectively.  First, the hierarchical routing causes the delay since the small number of S-GWs ( Serving Gateway ) and P-GWs lead to additional routing delay~\cite{banerjee2013moca,dong20113g}.  Second, the traffic from mobile users always go through the P-GW ( Packet Data Network Gateway) which routes the packet to internet as well as operates many functionality like QoS ( Quality of Service ), charging, and NAT ( Network Address Translation ).  It will be the bottleneck in current mobile network. 


- Explain that it is hard to modify current mobile network because of compatibility with other network ( e.g, circuit network, 3G, wifi, and Wimax )

To overcome these inherent problems and provide quality of service for users when they use delay critical applications, we propose the traffic offloading service in core network to reduce the delay by hierarchical routing and centralized P-GW without any modifications of the current mobile network.
