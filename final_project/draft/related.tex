\section{Related Work}

Our work is strongly inspired by MOCA ~\cite{banerjee2013moca}. In MOCA architecture, although modifications on the current network were intentionally minimized, the MME still played a centralized role and need to be modified. Our work, in the other hand, does not require any change on the MME or any component in the current architecture. The only requirement is traffic between eNodeBs and SGW have to go through SDN switches.\\

Local IP Access (LIAP) and Selected IP Traffic Offload (SITOP) have been proposed in 3GPP standard for data offloading. While LIAP is more suitable for home environments, SITOP is proposed to route data out of the core network as soon as possible but not to the CDN servers inside the core. LIAP and SITOP also require specific hardware to be deploy while the goal of our work is not to touch the current components.\\

There are works ~\cite{jin2013softcell, li2012toward} that address scalability and inflexibility problems of PGW using SDN. These works suggest the possibility of using SDN to enable flexible routing inside the core. MOCA relates to the works in the sense that it leverages SDN to share the pressure of data delivering on the PGW.\\
