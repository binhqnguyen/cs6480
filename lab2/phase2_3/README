Binh Nguyen
========================================================
	
1. Prerequisites:
----------------
	a. hdparm installed on receiver/sender.
	b. apache2 web server on sender.
	Note: Both of the prerequisites are satisfied 
	when doing Demo.
2. Run:
--------
	a. Important: VM0 is the sender, VM1 is the receiver.
	b. All scripts are located in /users/cs6480/binh6480/6480/lab2/phase2_3/
	folder.
	---------------------------
	Phase 2:
	--------
	i. Log into receiver (VM1) and run "./receiver.p2" 
		*Note: the receiver's script has to run before 
			sender's script. It takes the receiver 
			sometime for preparation.
	ii. After starting receiver's script, log into sender (VM0) 
	and run "./sender 110011", where 110011 is the 
	signal that the sender wants to send. The same string 
	should appear at the receiver.
	----------------------------
	Phase 3:
	---------
	i. Log into the receiver (VM1) and run "./receiver.p3".
	ii. Log into the "othernode" and run "./trigger"
	iii. The receiver should see "111111.." when the trigger 
	starts and "000000..." otherwise.
